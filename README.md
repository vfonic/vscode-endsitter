# vscode-endsitter

This is an extension that wisely adds the "end" keyword to code structures in Ruby while keeping the correct indentation levels.

This is a fork of excellent [endsitter](https://github.com/jemmyw/vscode-endwise/tree/tree-sitter).

Just hit `enter` to get your block automagically closed. `ctrl+enter` / `cmd+enter` closed from the middle of the line as well.
